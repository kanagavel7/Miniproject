## Customizable E‑commerce Clothing Platform for Personalised Fashion
The development of a customizable e‑commerce clothing platform that allows users to design personalised T‑shirts and hoodies in real time, simplifying online apparel customization and enhancing the overall fashion shopping experience.

## About
Tailmate is a web-based customizable apparel e-commerce platform that enables users to design and purchase personalised oversized T‑shirts, regular T‑shirts, and hoodies through an intuitive, real-time interface. Traditional fashion e‑commerce sites mostly sell pre-designed products with limited personalization, forcing users to adjust to fixed styles instead of expressing their own creativity. This project overcomes that limitation by offering live design customization and multi‑view previews while keeping the system lightweight, open-source, and student/startup friendly.

## Features
- Real-time apparel customization with support for uploading designs, adding stylish text, and choosing from predefined templates.​
- Multi-view garment preview (front, back, side) to visualize designs before confirming orders.​
- Responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for smooth usage across desktop and mobile devices.​
- Firebase-backed authentication using Google Sign-In for secure and simple user onboarding.​
- Cloud-based Firestore database for real-time product, user, and order management.​
- Firebase Storage integration to handle user-uploaded artwork and design assets.​
- Admin dashboard for order tracking, product updates, and user management in a single place.​
- Modular architecture designed for easy extension with payment gateway, analytics, and AI-based features.​

## Requirements
- Operating System: Any modern 64‑bit OS such as Windows 10/11, Ubuntu, or other Linux distributions for running the development stack and local server.​
- Development Environment: Latest versions of modern browsers (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) plus a code editor such as VS Code for editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.​
- Frontend Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for building responsive pages, product listings, and the customization canvas.​
- Backend/Cloud Services: Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Storage for user login, real-time data, and media storage, along with Firebase Hosting for deployment.​
- Tools and Utilities: Git/GitHub for version control, Figma/Canva for UI mockups and design assets, and Node.js/npm (optional) for build tools or bundlers if required.

The system reduces dependency on closed, costly services like Printful or Redbubble and offers a deployable reference for students and small businesses to experiment with personalized apparel commerce. It also provides a practical learning environment for web development, cloud integration, and UX design, forming a base for future upgrades like payment integration, AI style suggestions, and AR try‑on.
